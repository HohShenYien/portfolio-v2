## Background

I have been studying in Computer Science with a major in **Data Analytics** for nearly 2 years since
September 2020. However, I have always asked myself **if I am really into the data field?** Then,
after an opportunity that I had in joining a startup to build web applications, I realized that
**web development suited me much better than the data field**.

## Doubts

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px !important">
Throughout my journey in Data Analytics, I have been hearing about the life of data analysts,
data scientists, etc. through talks or some vlogs. From there, I had some doubts:
</p>

- Do I really enjoy working with numbers?
- Is building dashboards / visualizations something that I look forward to doing most of the time?
- Will I like spending hours on optimizing a model to get slight improvement in performance?
- Given that many of the tools available are GUI tools, do I really like using so much of drag-and-drop tools?
- Will I enjoy spending more time in analyzing compared to coding?

<p style="margin-top: 16px !important">
Unfortunately, my answers to these are <b>mostly no</b>. I might have some misconceptions towards the 
day-to-day life of a data specialist, however, these are some great doubts that <b>pushed me away from</b>
the data field.

## The Web Dev

<h-link href="/project/oye" target="_blank">OYE E-Album Editor</h-link>, the first fullstack web application that I attempted.

Since the first <h-link href="/project/csdiary-old" target="_blank">website (blog)</h-link> that I created through jekyll,
I became more interested in building websites. Soon, I joined a startup which provided me an 
opportunity to get in-depth with framework like Vue and Laravel that opened yet another gate
to me. 

When I built the <h-link href="/project/oye" target="_blank">OYE E-Album Editor</h-link>, it really
inspired me in how much I could achieve with these frameworks, both frontend and backend. What
I really like is **viewing** what I am building visually with instant feedback.

Besides, when I am reading web development / design books, I truly **enjoyed them** while 
data analytics books? Perhaps? They are interesting, but more often than not, **too abstract** 
for me, and it's hard for me to visualize those concepts partly due to my weak math foundation.
(I didn't really get formal linear algebra & calculus courses before)

## The Decision

As I needed to start my internship soon in **July 2022**, I had to finally make my decision.
I was still planning to **experience the data analyst career** before making my decision, so
I started with applying internships in data fields, however, I wonder if it was due
to the lack of my data projects / skills, most of the emails and applications **do not
receive any response within 1 week**. 

Thus, I began to apply for web development interns. Immediately in few days, I received a response from
<h-link href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/supplycart/">SupplyCart</h-link> with a coding assessment. 
The reason I applied for them was due to the **same stack** was being used in my startup, and I had plenty
of experience in them (Laravel and Vue). 

Furthermore, the interview session with them was amazing! They offered me the internship the next day with
a good compensation. Most importantly, I got to join as a front end back end developer intern, which is
very close to my goal as **fullstack developer**. Therefore, I decided to join them.

It was this decision that I made that I finally decided to quit the data field and join the
web development field. This was how I switched my career goal!

## Other Reasons

<p style="margin-bottom: 8px !important">
Of course, those aren't the only reasons, some other reasons being:
</p>

- I love coding, and I enjoy exploring UI/UX field too! (Apparently DA doesn't code as much in Malaysia)
- There are **a lot** more job opportunities as Software Engineer, at least in Malaysia.
- The salary of Software Engineer in Malaysia is always great!
- There is a feeling of emptiness when I'm doing DA, like the feeling of "what's next?" or "so?" hovering when I am doing it.
- At this point, I've done so much more in Web Development that it'll provide me a much better head start in my career.

## End Thoughts

I do not know if at one point of my life I will regret my decision now. However, after careful
considerations and balancing with my interest, I believe that this is the best decision for me now!
