Programming and Reading seem to belong to two different worlds, or are they?

Since the beginning of my journey in programming, 
Iâ€™ve rarely met any fellow who is actually into reading non-fictions.
In a way or two, many of us think that us as a programmer, **programming is not something to be learned from a book**.

Of course, itâ€™s not really wrong, as most of us gained our knowledge from some YouTube courses,
short tutorials, and most importantly StackOverflow answers, right? ðŸ˜†

Nevertheless, from my perspective, itâ€™s hard to replace a traditional book (or E-books).

## My Reading Journey

### Science Books

Aside from fictional books and kidsâ€™ encyclopedia, I remember my very first memorable books was a red cover 
1980â€™s book of science articles and facts which piqued my interests to the subject. 
Since then, I started to read and study more on Math and Sciences.

As time goes on, this indirectly led to a better results in high school, which I still appreciate my interest back then.
It can be said that this book has instilled a reading habit and brought me a lot of positive changes in my life!
However, I gave up on Science during college but this will be another dayâ€™s story.

### Programming Books

During college, I came across my first programming book, 
<h-link href="https://www.amazon.com/Java-Beginners-Eighth-Herbert-Schildt/dp/1260440214">Java: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide</h-link> 
(Java was the second language I learned after Python) and this book played a big role in my learning.

It was then I realized how powerful books are especially in learning, which led me to reading other books 
like **Grokking Algorithms, Head First C, Clean Codes**, and more!

## Books are Irreplaceable

Provided that you found yourself some good books, Iâ€™m sure you would agree that books canâ€™t be
replaced by online resources. Here are my two cents why it is so,

### 1. Systematic Learning

Books helped to build my solid foundation

A book gives us a **syllabus**, something that informal learning like reading tutorials or watching Master Python
in 30 minutes will not provide. From the **fundamentals to advanced concepts**. Most importantly, we (or maybe just me?)
tend to not skip any chapter in books.

Especially in introductory books, where it is assumed that the readers have no prior knowledge in the matter,
a book will usually **try to build a strong foundation** for us before we understand further.
Starting off with simple examples, and slowly we get to learn about advanced concepts.

Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding to the subject.

### 2. Breadth of Knowledge

</post-image>

There are just things you think you wonâ€™t need the first time you learn. For example?
I wondered what was the use of **Generics, Polymorphism, or even Iterator** when 
I first came into them. If they werenâ€™t listed on a book, I swear I wonâ€™t even touch them till the point
I truly came across them, which might be too late.

Over time, these **unimportant knowledge will appear** in places that Iâ€™d never expect. For example,
during one of my university courses assignment, we are required to build linked list to store a
few data structures (Teacher, Subject, Centre).

Without what I learned, I would have done something like

```cpp
struct TeacherNode {}
struct SubjectNode {}
struct CentreNode {}

class TeacherList {}
class SubjectList {}
class CentreList {}
```

However, thanks to the generic that I learned from Java, I managed to make my life easier

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct Node<T> {}

template <typename T>
class LinkedList<T> {}
```

Though they might seem somewhat irrelevant, but my point is that we do not know when a knowledge is going to be important. Hence, by reading, we will keep them in our toolbox and itâ€™ll always be ready whenever we need it.

### 3. Better Memory

Obviously, when the chapters are interrelated, youâ€™ll unconsciously relate them and have a better 
understandings. **With great understandings comes great memory** ðŸ•·, 
and so it is unsurprising that we can remember better when we read from books, right?

Honestly, with the vast amount of content from a book, I believe that even just **partial
memory still means a lot** and will have sufficient impact to us. As for those parts that we forget,
we still somewhat have an idea that we have learned them, and hopefully one day when we come across
them, we will remember where did we see it ðŸ¤¥

## A Reading Habit

Continuous Effort is key to a habit

Soâ€¦ how to get started and eventually make it a habit? Honestly, itâ€™s still hard for me now.

I have set myself a goal to achieve a book a month, and undoubtedly, 
I have been doing well (<h-link href="/goals">check them here</h-link>). However, even after 8 months of reading, 
I donâ€™t really have a reading habit just yet, though I am **getting better to force myself reading**.

Hence, I guess the best starting point for everyone is a 
**less intensive reading of a topic that youâ€™re interested in**. Take me for example, 
if you were to give me the Designing Data Intensive Application (DDIA) early this year,
I doubt I could stick to it for long.

Nevertheless, equipped with more experience and discipline in reading, I am starting to enjoy deeper
books (still not ready for books like The Dragon Bookâ€¦) though Iâ€™d still love to read colorful books.

## Final Words

For me, books are becoming an **essential part of my life**. Believe it or not, books helped me to grow,
not just as a developer, but as a human overall (since I also read other types of books). 
Letâ€™s pick up a book and start reading now! ðŸ“–
