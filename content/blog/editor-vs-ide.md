As a programmer, it can be said that the app we use to write codes, be it Editor or IDE,
is the most important tool in our toolbox üß∞. 
The question boils down to what‚Äôs the best application out there that can help us code even more efficiently?

## Wait‚Ä¶ What are they?

You do write codes, right‚Ä¶? (Why would you be here if you‚Äôre not a programmer) 
Anyway, editor or IDE is basically an app that lets you write your codes, it could be as simple as 
Windows‚Äô Notepad or as huge as JetBrains‚Äôs IDE.

### Differences

Nevertheless, Editor and IDE are pretty much different from one another, and you can probably identify 
them by yourself.

#### Editor

As the name suggested, editor is an app that helps you in editing codes. 
That‚Äôs it, in essence the app won‚Äôt be doing more than that. For instance, some famous editors are VS Code,
Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad, Notepad++, Nano and Vim.

An editor will usually provide features like code completion, error or warnings,
and syntax highlighting. Of course, with the various plugins available, sometimes you can make your editor as
powerful as IDE!

#### IDE

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) essentially offers an environment that includes everything 
from build tools, debugging tools, to better autocomplete. The most popular IDEs are from Jetbrains: Intellij,
PHPStorm, Webstorm, RubyStorm, Pycharm, CLion, etc.

In short, you can basically call IDE a supercharged version of an Editor ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Of course, the additional 
features come with a cost, or more, i.e., your RAM, your CPU, and more often than not, your money üí∏üí∏

## Examples

I will share some of the apps that I have used before and how good are they

### 1. Editors

#### Sublime Text

It was my first editor, and in comparison to other apps, it is the simplest editor out there,
and as a benefit, it is not that as heavy in comparison to other apps. 
Nevertheless, you won‚Äôt expect too many advanced features here.

#### Vim

A very advanced terminal-based modal editor that I always wanted to learn (even in my annual goals, 
not much progress on it yet). It has a super steep learning curve, but legends have it that those who master 
this art can program very fast.

#### Visual Studio Code

Probably the most famous editor out there, very extensible and suitable for all cases. VS Code comes 
with many plugins available in its marketplace, so with some tweaks and its own Intellisense, 
you can get a pretty smart editor that suggests you on what to type. This is also my most used editors during work.

### 2. IDE

#### Jetbrains Products

I call them the premium IDE. Really, they have the fanciest and modern looks in comparison to other IDEs, 
perhaps because IDEs are their products. But aside from price, and its high RAM and CPU usage, Jetbrains 
Products is really the gold standard out there.

Although there are lesser plugins and additional add-ons, but it is super simple to use!

#### Visual Studio

On the other hand, Visual Studio is just‚Ä¶ Visual Studio. It has a relatively complex layout and a lot of tools 
that some professionals might use them all.

Due to it being the Microsoft‚Äôs IDE, it is the go-to IDE for any Microsoft‚Äôs stuffs, like C# for Microsoft apps, 
data analysis with Microsoft‚Äôs SQL server, you get me. Personally, I‚Äôm not really a fan of this IDE.

## Which is the Best?

As usual, there isn‚Äôt an absolute best here. It all depends on the use case, your preference, and sometimes,
even your machine‚Äôs tech spec will matter too.

### Editor

Editor, especially VS Code, is suitable for you if:
1. **Your machine is on low end**, with only like 4-8 GB of RAM and older versions of CPU. If this is the case, an IDE might take more than 50% of your computer‚Äôs resources, thus slowing down your work.
2. **You are coding in relatively new / rare languages**, like Carbon. Normally, syntax highlighting, code autocompletion and syntax checking for new languages will be available on VS Code due to its huge community, while IDE usually have smaller communities.
3. **You are looking for features that are only available in VS Code** (e.g., live share & code together).
4. **You are coding across multiple languages in a single project.** More often than not, IDE only supports a set of languages, and the language you‚Äôre working on might not be available in it.

### IDE

1. You are working with **compiled languages** like C, C++, C#, or Java. These languages would often require you to build the project with some tools, and IDEs can greatly save your pain to help you build them easily.
2. **Your programming language has a good IDE**, not all languages receive same popularity, you can probably find a dozen of IDE for Java, but probably few if not none for Haskell.
3. You are new to programming, IDEs better autocompletion support and other features can really help beginners to focus more on logical syntax, rather than on imports and all.

## Bottom Line

It really boils down to a matter of personal preference: do give both tools a try, and see what fits best for you!
